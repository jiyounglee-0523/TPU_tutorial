## TPU Research Cloud (TRC) program
### What is TRC program?
TRC enables researchers to apply for access to a cluster of more than 1,000 Cloud TPUs. **Researchers accepted into the TRC program will have access to v2 and v3 devices at no charge** and can leverage a variety of frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Julia and JAX to accelerate the next wave of open research breakthroughs.

Participants in the TRC program will be expected to share their TRC-supported research with the world through peer-reviewed publications, open source code, blog posts, or other means. They should also be willing to share detailed feedback with Google to help us improve the TRC program and the underlying Cloud TPU platform over time. In addition, participants accept Google's Terms and Conditions, acknowledge that their information will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy, and agree to conduct their research in accordance with the Google AI principles.

### How many machines they provide?
+ 5 TPU V2-8 (64GB, 180 peak TFLOPS)
+ 5 TPU V3-8 (128GB, 420 peak TFLOPS)
+ 100 Colab TPUs (can use <24hrs)

### TRC application link
You can grant an access to TPUs within a week! [Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBXCs4vatyQUcePgRKh_ZiKhEODXkkoeqAKzFa_d-oSVp3iw/viewfor)
